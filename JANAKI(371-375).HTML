        <p class="a">On the other hand, WHIN serves as both an application (CHIN) vendor and an IOS<br>
            venture electronically supporting its multiple health care participants. What differen-<br>
            tiates these situations, and what implications can we draw from this for our model of IOS<br>
            implementation?</p>
        <p class="a">
            &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the biggest difference in the study results between WHIN on the one hand<br>
            and RHINNO and NEOHN on the other, is the apparent impact of Push/Pull Factors.<br>
            While these factors showed little impact in the WHIN case, they had a largely negative<br>
            impact for both RHINNO and NEOHN implementation. These factors are, no doubt,<br>
            related to the environment. The nature of the market, geographical location, and<br>
            infrastructure supporting CHIN implementation differentiates WHIN from the other two<br>
            cases. The Wisconsin market is characterized by a fairly large group of relatively small,<br>
            non-competing health care providers. CHIN implementation in this environment is not<br>
            a zero-sum game. CHIN participants stand to lose little by engaging in cooperative<br>
            information exchange processes. WHIN participants, unlike those in RHINNO and<br>
            NEOHN, do not appear to endorse the idea that one organization’s gain is another’s loss.<br>
            Further, CHIN participation becomes particularly appealing as smaller organizations<br>
            recognize their inability to fund such massive infrastructures on their own, and larger,<br>
            free-standing hospitals and payors realize their limited ability to finance the expenditures<br>
            associated with implementation. WHIN and its participants are located in a smaller urban<br>
            environment (unlike CHIN initiatives in New York, Chicago, and Cleveland), where health<br>
            care players tend to be geographically dispersed. This, in part, engenders the need to<br>
            electronically share information and may explain the lack of concern for competitive<br>
            forces in the WHIN case.</p>
            <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 2 shows how the nature of the competitive environment might impact the<br>
                desirability of shared IOS, including CHINs. In a large, urban market with many<br>
                competing health care providers and/or payment plans, a highly competitive market<br>
                develops (Box 1 of Figure 2). Institutions within this market are generally technologically<br>
                sophisticated and often have their own, internal health care information systems and<br>
                procedures in place to enable electronic data sharing. The nature of such markets could<br>
                hinder CHIN implementations. Organizations in these competitive markets are likely to<br>
                be unwilling to share information due to the perceived threat of competition. Conse-<br>
                quently, there appears to be little justification for interorganizational cooperation or a<br>
                voluntary CHIN in such markets. The Cleveland metropolitan market has these charac-<br>
                teristics, and this may explain the failure of RHINNO to develop.<br>
               </p>  
               <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;At the other extreme, small cities or rural areas with relatively few, geographically<br>
                dispersed health care providers and payors present non-competitive markets (Box 4 of<br>
                Figure 2). CHIN participation is most attractive in these cases, as organizations can<br>
                engage in information sharing with little or no perceived threat of competition. The lack<br>
                of service redundancy in the marketplace increases the likelihood that information<br>
                sharing utilizing a shared infrastructure can add value. Markets in larger, less populous<br>
                states are examples that fit this model. In such markets, push/pull factors like competition<br>
                and economics as identified in the proposed CHIN implementation model (Figure 1) would<br>
                likely favor implementation.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Boxes 2 and 3 represent moderately competitive markets, which can develop both<br>
                    in large and small metropolitan regions. These settings fall somewhere between the<br>
                    extremes of those markets characterized by Box 1 or 4. They are likely to be smaller<br>
                    markets, or markets with less “density” of medical providers and payors. These are likely</p>
                <p class="a"><i>Figure 2: Market/location matrix</i></p>  
                <img src="picture1.png">
                <p class="a">to be markets where the impact of competitive and economic factors on CHIN/IOS<br>
                    implementation is more difficult to predict. Markets like Milwaukee and Akron would<br>
                    seem to fall into this category. In Milwaukee, the lower degree of competition allowed<br>
                    WHIN to proceed successfully. In Akron, on the other hand, NEOHN was less<br>
                    successful, perhaps due to the proximity (and overlapping) of Cleveland (and RHINNO),<br>
                    a large, competitive (Box 1) market.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;These different market situations suggest the need for alternative models, both for<br>
                    CHIN functioning and for CHIN implementation. Health care players in highly competi-<br>
                    tive environments may participate in IOS educational, general organizational informa-<br>
                    tion, and clinical services. Similar to trade associations, such health care cooperatives<br>
                    could pool resources to gain power through political lobbying, engage in knowledge<br>
                    transfer particularly in specialized domains, and seek purchase discounts for needed<br>
                    technologies and services. Widespread sharing of patient information, however, will not<br>
                    occur easily in such markets, as powerful players develop proprietary systems to serve<br>
                    their own needs and maximize their individual market shares. In less competitive markets,<br>
                    the true potential of CHIN functionality for sharing data among multiple providers is more<br>
                    likely to be realized.
                    </p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As is evident from this study, the factors affecting CHIN implementation are likely<br>
                    to differ in different market situations. While Behavioral Factors seemed to play similar<br>
                    roles in each case, Push/Pull Factors and Shared System Topology (infrastructure)<br>
                    factors did not. The conditions for success depicted in the research model appear to be<br>
                    unattainable in certain environmental scenarios. This is particularly the case in environ-<br>
                    ments characterized as a highly competitive. In these cases, the competitive forces,<br>
                    </p>
                <p class="a">economic justification, political issues, and IOS enablers are most critical to determining<br>
                    implementation success – they emerged as the go/no-go factors in the research model.<br>
                    Thus, it appears that the market for cooperative CHINs may be limited.</p>
                    <h4>HOW THE PLATFORM CAN BE USED</h4>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;CHIN technology would enable health care constituents to electronically create,<br>
                    maintain, and transform medical data via internal organizational and network-wide<br>
                    databases. Medical information can be housed in several tables, such as patient info,<br>
                    employer info, dependent info, medical records, physician info, etc. Attributes describ-<br>
                    ing each entity with appropriate relationships would be established. These databases<br>
                    can, then, feed into a data warehouse with data marts for each CHIN constituent. These<br>
                    data marts can be used to manage specialized processing by individual CHIN organiza-<br>
                    tion. Data from the CHIN overarching database is extractable to facilitate data-mining<br>
                    processes.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Data mining often follows one of several methods:</p>
                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Predictive modeling — includes classification and regression techniques that are<br>
                    used to forecast unknown outcomes or variables;
                    </p>
                <p class="a">2)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Clustering – establishes clusters (based on an analogous statistic) in order to<br>
                    compare historical data to analyze new data;</p>
                <p class="a">3)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Association – determines relationships between attributes in a database that often<br>
                    can be correlated as a result of causality; and</p>
                <p class="a">4)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Summarization – generalizes task-specific data into a data cube that can create<br>
                    graphical representations.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;While several organizations (IBM, Oracle, Silicon Graphics, Angoss, SAS, and<br>
                    SPSS) offer data-mining technologies, the SAS Enterprise model is provided, herein, to<br>
                    show the technology interface (Figure 3). The SAS system supports a myriad of mining<br>
                    models, including decision trees, regression, and neutral networks.</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Once mined, the data offers its owners knowledge regarding fraud, profiling,<br>
                    retention, and profit analyses. In general, these methods provide organizations using<br>
                    on-line analytical processing (OLAP) with a multidimensional, logical view of critical<br>
                    data. Thus, strategic knowledge can be derived using forecasting, trend analyses, and<br>
                    statistical analyses. For health care organizations, in particular, data-mining solutions<br>
                    can provide payors, hospitals, alternative delivery systems, clinics, physicians, and<br>
                    home health agencies with more succinct, meaningful answers to issues, such as:</p>
                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (In)effective methods of patient care;</p>
                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Local and regional health statistics;</p>

                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Cost analyses by segments of a population, provider plan, or demographic group;</p>

                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Drug subscription, treatment, utilization, etc.;</p>

                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;  Genetic treatment, medical research, and discovery; and</p>

                <p class="a">1)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; (In)effective methods for mining “text-based” clinical data</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;As Figure 2 suggested, regional markets in Boxes 1 and 4 are best suited for these<br>
                    implementations. Moreover, Box 1 (Highly Competitive Medical Markets) is likely to</p>
                <p class="a"><i>Figure 3: The SAS Enterprise data-mining technology (http://www.sas.com/products/<br>
                    miner/index.html).</i></p>
                <img src="picture2.png">
                <p class="a">serve as an ideal environment given the presence of larger number of payor plans and<br>
                    enrollees – thereby resting on the notion that CHIN participants are in need of vital data<br>
                    analyses on cost effectiveness, profitability, treatment, resource utilization, etc. In<br>
                    noncompetitive environments (Box 4), the health information network fosters a coupling<br>
                    on dispersed groups where competition and economic dimensions are not the primary<br>
                    drivers of the implementation</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To this end, CHIN technologies offer the industry the ability to better mine larger<br>
                    sets of data to accomplish four critical analyses:</p>
                <p class="a">1) Fraud Detection – Of particular interest to health care providers, this application<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;features provider and patient profiling along with behavior and resource utilization,<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;charting tools, and detection functionality. Data mining via CHIN technologies<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;permits continuous monitoring on the above, yet these analyses are performed on<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;a broader scale (i.e., local, state, and regional levels).<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover, similar to fraud detection among credit card agencies, CHIN constitu-<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ents, particularly government agencies, can mine data to discover (mis)uses of<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;medical benefits, monetary losses, and legal infractions</p>
                <p class="a">2) Profitability Analysis – Figure 1 and the material that follows clearly points out the<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;criticality of the implementation process. As noted in Table 2, every CHIN</p>
                <p class="a"> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;participant organization was significantly concerned about the economic dimen-<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;sions associated with investing in the network technologies in question.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;While the CHIN technology enables larger data sets to analyzed, its users can<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;conduct additional regional analyses by metropolitan areas, counties, states, and<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;districts. Effective health care plans, services, care delivery plans, and even those<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;“profit generating” physicians - can be determined. Ineffective or non-profitable<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;services can then be eliminated based on the more global analyses generated from<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;data-mining technologies.</p>
                <p class="a">3)Patient Profiling – By using psychographic data, CHIN research members can gain<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;amore extensive examination of patient behavior to uncover treatment and care<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;service utilization patterns. For example, mined data could profile patients by<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;physicians visited and medical tests ordered, drug treatment, gender, ethnicity,<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;age, episode of illnesses, just to name a few.<br>
                    </p>
                <p class="a">4) Retention Management – Customer relationship management is linked to the notion<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;of retention management. Ideally, health care payors would like to retain their<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;existing customer bases while attracting and converting potential customers to<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;enrollees. Data mining via the CHIN facilitates cross-selling and electronic market-<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ing services. While the case can be made for preserving patient members, health<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;care groups must also think in terms of “retaining” physician members as well.<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, identifying services critical to participating physician groups can be just as<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;fundamental.</p>
                <h4 class="b">DATA-MINING IMPLICATIONS:</h4>
                <h4 >CONTROVERSIES AND ISSUES ASSOCIATED</h4>
                <h4  class="c">WITH CHINS</h4>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;A close examination of Table 2 suggests the primary determinants in attaining a<br>
                    successful CHIN implementation are overcoming<i> Competition, Economic, Organiza-<br>
                    tional Autonomy and Control and Political Issues </i>– thereby indicating that the technical<br>
                    or technology implementation is not the deterrent. Rather, the above issues relate to the<br>
                    broader social and political dynamics of the health care industry. Of the thirty interviews<br>
                    with members of these projects, there was consistent concern about two issues: 1) what<br>
                    is the purpose of warehousing community data?, and 2) how should the data be used?</p>
                <p class="a">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;To address the first question, numerous writings have offered rationale for ware-<br>
                    housing health care data. For instance, the 2001 American Medical Informatics Asso-<br>
                    ciation Conference (http://www.amia.org) hosted several panels and paper sessions to<br>
                    address the needs of warehousing medical data; these assessments included:</p>
                <p class="a">1) &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the critical integration of clinical and administrative data from a myriad of source<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;systems;</p>
                <p class="a">2)  &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;determination of cost efficiency measures between the general population and<br>
                    &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;individual patient; and</p>
                <p class="a">3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; retrospective and prospective studies of medical history, prescriptions and labo-<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ratory results among patient medical records.</p>
